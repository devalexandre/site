title: Statistics
---
Moleculer has a statistics module that collects and aggregates the count & latency info of the requests.
You can enable it in the [broker options](broker.html#Broker-options) with `statistics: true`. 
{% note warn %}
The data is stored only in **memory**. If you would like to store it, you have to do it!
You can access the statistics data if you call the internal `$node.stats` action.
{% endnote %}

The result looks like the following:

```js
{
  "requests": {
    // Total statistics
    "total": {

      // Count of requests
      "count": 45,

      // Count of error by code
      "errors": {},

      // Req/sec values
      "rps": {
        "current": 0.7999854548099126,
        // Last x values
        "values": [

        ]
      },

      // Request latency values (ms)
      "latency": {
